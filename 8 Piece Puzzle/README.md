## Instructions using the cpp file:
Download thecpp file and open in an IDE. Make sure your input files are in this project’s folder. When you run the code, it will ask you type in the file you want as the input. (e.g “Input.txt”). This will create a file called “Output.txt” with the results. If you want, you can change the output file name in the code. 

## Using the exe file:
Run the executable and type in the input file you want to use. (e.g. “Input1.txt”). Make sure that the input file and the .exe file are in the same folder / level. This will output the results in a text file called “Output.txt”.
